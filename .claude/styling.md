# Portfolio Design Philosophy

Engineering seriousness. Clarity and restraint.

---

## Core Principle

Design systems where correctness matters more than appearance.

---

## Visual Identity

**Color:**
- Warm, muted palette (beige/cream background, near-black text)
- One accent (muted gold)
- Gray for secondary info only

**Spacing:**
- Massive breathing room between sections
- 8px base unit
- More space = more importance

**Typography:**
- Serif (Garamond) for gravity: headlines, titles
- Sans (Inter) for clarity: body, metadata
- Never bold—use italic
- Generous line spacing

---

## Interaction

**Links:** Underline on hover. Opacity change.

**Buttons:** Transparent, underlined text. No boxes.

**Animations:** Opacity fades only (600ms+). No transforms.

**Scrollbar:** Hidden but functional.

---

## Forbidden

- Rounded corners
- Drop shadows
- Gradients
- Moving/scaling animations
- Color transitions
- Parallax
- Decorative elements

## Success Metric

When a senior engineer visits and thinks: **"This person is precise."**

Not "cool." Not "artsy." Precise.
